# Zoom car website automation using puppeteer and nodejs and mail is send by using nodemailer.
We are booking cars for form one location to other, 
now for this we require to fill in information but for this we used automation and after automation completes it simply tells you if car is available or not by sending mail on your email-id.  
We are doing this by applying unique selectors and employing puppeteer to work upon it. 

I wrote an app which automates Zoom Car website basically it will show you whether car is available or not. So that from next time when you arive on Delhi airport you don't need to do that extra clicks tell only information and you are good to go.This automation is done using #puppeteer.
